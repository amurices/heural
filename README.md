Haskell ***toy*** neural network

### Cool things to do:
1. Maybe use a matrix library to represent weights.
2. Finish neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com, the basis for this thing.
3. Implement features of the `Network` record as a monad transformer stack.
4. Use the type constructor `NetworkP` to provide a `Traversable` to hold network data.
5. Use Adam instead of a static eta
